# EasyQ

#### EasyQ will offer a platform to people to sit where ever they are and not stand in tiresome lines/queues and wait for their turn to come in hospitals, dispensaries, canteens, banks, restaurants etc etc where all you need tokens to wait. EasyQ will help you issue a token online so you don't have to be physically present before you actually need to and will ease the life of both the customer and the person on the other side of the table as it will not only help the person standing in the line but also the dealer as there will be less chaos in the institution.

### Tools and Plaforms used
- **MYSQL** for database.
- **JAVASCRIPT & JQUERY** for client side.
- **BOOTSTRAP** for Front-end.
- **Google Maps API (Distance Matrix) & Geolocation API** for different data calculations.

### Acknowledgement
##### The project got third position in _DEVJAM 1.0_ annual developing event of MNNIT, ALLAHABAD.
